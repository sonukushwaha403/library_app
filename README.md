Its quarkus based project for Microservices implemetation 
"# library_app" 
Here I have  developed two RESTful microservices that talk to each other.
After that bootstrapping two Quarkus microservices, to running them as Docker containers.

follow up steps:

* Develop two microservice that expose REST endpoints using JAX-RS and CDI
* Customize the JSON output with JSON-B
* Configure each microservice
* Document each microservice with MicroProfile OpenAPI
* Establish the communication between microservices with MicroProfile REST Client
* Mock the microservice communication when testing
* Handle communication failure with MicroProfile Fault Tolerance

* Build a Linux executable with GraalVM out of each microservice
* Containerize each microservice with Docker and execute it
* Create and configure a Docker Compose file so both microservices can be executed in a single command

here we have implemented RESTful microservices with Quarkus.
